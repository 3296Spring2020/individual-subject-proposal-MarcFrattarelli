# Marc Frattarelli Project proposal

## Description	
-  FixMyStreet is a project made to help people have a way to bring up problems in the community and create support solutions and push issues to get resolved. There are many FixMyStreet apps, however to my knowlege, none have been made for the city of philadelphia. There are constantly issues that people have with society, but specifically focusing on the more concrete things that are not emergencies. This would be more like if there is broken infrastructure in a community that the city is not fixing or for people to request more bike lanes in an area, or for the streets to get cleaned. A user can post one of these requests onto the app's database with pictures and get feedback through comments as well as add updates. This project could add fuctionality to create a way to post solutions to these problems. For example: raising money, scheduling a protest, or starting a petition. Fuctionality could also be added so these responses can also get voted on. There is also a dataset of complaints of this type on opendataphilly.org. On top of this there is more data on this website that, if integrated with the application, could be provided to users to cite issues or use in solutions. For example, there is a database of arrests, jail time, and bail which could be cited for a complaint based around arrest discrimination. 

## Relevance
-	This project utilizes many different technologies and focuses on putting them all together. It also is going to be fueled by test driven development. For example the best way to get APIs working is through testing. Git will also obviously be a requirement for all members. The implementation of agile methodologies like a trello/scrum board and ability to change plans will also be used in this project. We may find the original ideas or scope must be modified to accommodate other technologies or find that one of our tools can be replaced by something better. This will fuel small team work and collaboration. We will also need to use UML to map everything out as anything involving a network or API should be drawn first. This is also a usage of database technologies. This project also uses XML on top of all of this.
